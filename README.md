# VehicleCollisionAvoidance
The number of car crashes are increasing yearly due to the number of distracted driving being the major cause. Especially for the case of emergency vehicle where they must reach to the destination is of high importance associated with utmost need of achieve high speed in the highways. Emergency scenarios may necessitate autonomous vehicle maneuvers up to their handling limits to avoid collisions. In this project a scenario is created where these emergency vehicles must beat the traffic in a highway and reach to a destination as fast as they can. Proximal Policy Optimization is used to train the autonomous vehicle agent. The results shows that the autonomous vehicle indeed achieve the goal of covering maximum distance along with maintaining safety of other vehicles in the highway taking the information of positions and speeds of other vehicles present in the network. Flow and SUMO are used.
